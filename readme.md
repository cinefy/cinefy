#Cinefy

###How it works:

Whether you’re a movie buff, trivia master, music lover, connoisseur of fine clothes, or someone who likes to test drive the newest app, you’re going to love Cinefy.

Cinefy is the next big thing in movie watching. When you sign up for an account, you get instant access to behind-the-scenes info of all the movies you watch -- for free.

As you watch a movie on your computer or TV, your mobile feed will display timed notifications with interesting trivia, music, gorgeous set locations, and splurge-worthy products as seen in the film. If you see an item you’re interested in, simply tap the “like” button and it will be saved to your personal account for later reference.

Cinefy was developed in 2015 by a team of JavaScript and UI developers at Code Fellows. Thanks for checking us out!
