        As you watch a movie on your computer or TV, your mobile feed will display timed notifications with interesting trivia, music, gorgeous set locations, and splurge-worthy products as seen in the film. If you see an item you’re interested in, simply tap the “like” button and it will be saved to your personal account for reference later.
